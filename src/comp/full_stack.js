                <li><h4>Language Learning Website</h4>
                This project involved a creation of a website which helps a user to learn different languages such as french, english and spanish. The website offered videos which assisted in development of vocabulary and speaking skills. It consisted of texts which would help debelop their reading skills. Finally it also consisted of a quiz which tested their grammar and vocalbulary in different languages.<br></br>
                This project was a group effort and was developed with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript for frontend, PHP for backend and MySQL for the database. My role in this project involes creating the login page and validating users and I worked on the quiz page. The questions and options along with the correct respose were present in the database which will be fetched and displayed to the user. This project also uses sessions to ensure the users can not access the materials without creating an account and logging in.<br></br>
